# Monitoring

## Status page

SMSLib runs an embedded HTTP server. By visiting `http://localhost:8001/status`, you will see the SMSLib status page with some useful information about the Gateways running, basic messaging statistics, etc

The listening port as well as the permissions of this status page are [configurable](https://github.com/smslib/smslib/wiki/GeneralConfiguration).
